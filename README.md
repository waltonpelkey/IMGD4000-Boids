Walton Pelkey's Boids Submission for Individual Assignments credit

To run this code on your local computer download the zip file of the project. Then unzip the project. Finally run the uproject file from your directory. 

When using this project:
- You can change the values associated with the boids algorithm by selecting the boids manager object in the right panel. You can then scroll down and edit the properties such as strengths of ecah of the rules and their radii of effect. You can edit these values before running the code or during run time. And that's it!

Link to gameplay video:
- There is a mp4 file showcasing a short clip of me changing the values while running the simulation.

I would like to acknowledge the youtube tutorial that taught me how to implement boids using cpp.
